        <img src="1.jpg">Some people might argue that "nah, there are too many things involved in finance, so it is too pratical to use a computer to account for all the effects". It will be true if we don't have much data, but now we have huge amount of data that can be used to analyze finance. <br><br>
    Just look at the graph attached, there are so many things to do in a financial report, wouldn't it be nice if computer can learn how to do it and help us to do it with all the data?
